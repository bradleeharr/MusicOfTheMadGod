<h1> Purpose </h1> <a name="Purpose"/>


* The goal of this program is to add dynamic music integration in the game. 
* Currently, in various dungeons and in the Realm, there is no dynamic music integration.
* One example of this is when playing in the Realm:

 * In the main realm, the background track <a href="https://wangleline.bandcamp.com/track/odyssey" target="_blank">https://wangleline.bandcamp.com/track/odyssey</a> is repeated on end.
