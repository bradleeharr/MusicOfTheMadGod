<h1> Purpose </h1>

The goal of this program is to add dynamic music integration in the game. Currently, in various dungeons and in the Realm, there is no dynamic music integration.
One example of this is when playing in the Realm.

<h2> For example, the realm background track </h2>
https://wangleline.bandcamp.com/track/odyssey is repeated on end.

<h2 align="center"> Objectives </h1>

* Mute in-game Music
  * In-game music volume settings are set using `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\DECA Live Operations GmbH\RotMGExalt` registry
     * This registry can be edited and updates the Music on load-up, but does not help us set the volume over time, unfortuantely.
     * One goal would be to have the ability to allow in-game Music in certain circumstances, and remove it in others, but this is difficult to do without providing personal audio files
      

* Tracks Used (Royalty Free)

# Dance Pad
Using a Dance Pad with Realm of the Mad God requires an input to keyboard mapping software.
